# ep\_user\_displayname

Etherpad plugin that initializes the name displayed in the user list from a
value in the user's account settings. The account settings can come from
`settings.json` or an authentication plugin such as
[ep\_openid\_connect](https://github.com/ether/ep_openid_connect).

By default, users are not allowed to change their displayname if the displayname
is set in the user's account settings. This restriction can be changed
site-wide or with per-user overrides.

This plugin has no effect unless the `requireAuthentication` setting is `true`.

## Configuration

#### Example

```json
  "requireAuthentication": true,
  "ep_user_displayname": {
    "changeableByDefault": false
  },
  "users": {
    "admin": {
      "displayname": "Special User",
      "displaynameChangeable": true
    },
    "guest": {
      "displayname": "Read-Only Guest",
      "readOnly": true
    },
    "foo": {
      "displayname": "Ordinary User"
    }
  },
```

#### Details

  * `requireAuthentication`: Must be explicitly set to `true` to enable this
    plugin.
  * `ep_user_displayname.changeableByDefault` (optional, defaults to `false`):
    The default value for a user's `displaynameChangeable` setting if not
    explicitly set.
  * `users[username].displayname` (optional, defaults to unset): The user's
    displayname. If this is set and the user's `displaynameChangeable` setting
    is `false`, the user's displayname is always forced to this value. If this
    is set and the user's `displaynameChangeable` setting is `true`, this only
    serves as the displayname's initial value (it is ignored if the user's
    displayname is already known from a previous visit). If this is unset, the
    user's displayname is initially unset and the user is allowed to change
    their displayname to any value they want.
  * `users[username].displaynameChangeable` (optional, defaults to the value of
    `ep_user_displayname.changeableByDefault`): Whether the user is allowed to
    change their displayname. Note that a user's displayname is always
    changeable if their `displayname` setting is unset.
